# yhangry-test
Tech test for Yhangry with a React frontend, Node.js backend, and MySQL database. The project includes an API to filter and paginate set menus by cuisine, calculate total prices based on the number of guests, and implement Redux for state management. API optimization for fast querying and security considerations are also addressed.
